# wikipedia-search-engine

This repository contains a simple web application that allows users to search for articles on Wikipedia using the Wikipedia API. The application displays search results dynamically as the user types in the search input.

In this fork, debounce functionality has been added to improve performance by limiting the number of API calls made during rapid user input.
